Transport Data Analysis Project for a Spanish City

Description:
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of transport data for a Spanish city to uncover insights into the factors influencing traffic flow and the use of various transportation modes. The analysis focused on data related to population demographics, vehicle types, road conditions, and transport infrastructure.


Tools and Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Statistical Modeling: Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
Data Visualization: Matplotlib
Regression Analysis: Negative Binomial Regression

Methodology:
1)Data Collection:
Data was collected from multiple sources, including municipal records, census data, and transportation reports.
The dataset included variables such as population size, population density, vehicle types, road conditions, and the number of traffic incidents.

Data Cleaning:
The data was cleaned and processed using Pandas to ensure data quality and remove missing or erroneous values.
Categorical variables were converted into numerical ones using encoding techniques.

2) Statistical Modeling using Negative Binomial Regression:
The Negative Binomial Regression model was applied to analyze the relationship between the number of traffic incidents and independent variables like population density, vehicle types, and road quality.
The Negative Binomial model was chosen due to its suitability for data with overdispersion, where the variance exceeds the mean.

3) Key Variable Analysis:
The analysis revealed that population density was the most significant factor influencing traffic volume.
Vehicle types and road quality also played crucial roles in determining congestion levels and traffic flow.
Spatial analysis was used to map the distribution of traffic incidents across different city areas.

4) Recommendations:
Based on the findings, recommendations were made to improve transport infrastructure and road planning.
Strategies were suggested to enhance road quality and reduce traffic density in highly populated areas.
Conclusion:
This analysis provided valuable insights that can assist policymakers in improving urban planning and developing effective traffic management strategies. The statistical model identified the key variables affecting transportation, contributing to the development of sustainable transport policies.
